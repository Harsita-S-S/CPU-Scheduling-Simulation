# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a **CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator** implemented using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to upload a process scheduling dataset, apply different scheduling algorithms, and compare their performance visually.

## Features
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FIFO)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
  - Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
- Upload process data via an Excel file.
- Run a selected scheduling algorithm and display results in a table.
- Compare all algorithms with visualization and detailed performance metrics.
- Automatically determine the best algorithm based on turnaround time, throughput, and CPU idle time.

## Installation & Requirements
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl matplotlib
```

### Running the Simulator
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpu-scheduling-simulator.git
   cd cpu-scheduling-simulator
   ```
2. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Upload an Excel file** containing process scheduling data (with columns: ID, AT, ET, Priority).
2. **Select a scheduling algorithm** from the dropdown menu.
3. **Run the algorithm** to see computed values (CT, TAT, WT) in the table.
4. **Use "Compare All"** to visualize multiple scheduling algorithms and generate a report.

## Visualization & Comparison
When you select **"Compare All"**, `visualization.py` generates:
- A bar chart comparing **Throughput, Average Turnaround Time, and CPU Idle Time**.
- A **detailed report** determining the best algorithm based on performance metrics.
